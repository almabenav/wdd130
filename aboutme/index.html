    <h2>Alma Benavides</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Alma Benavides. I am 19 years old and i'm from Colombia. i'm currently single. 
        I love listen to music, most of the time during the day I listen to music. I also paint sometimes.</p>
    <p>I live with my parents and my two siblings, Amber Sariah the middle one and Andres Alejandro the youngest, I am the oldest. 
        My whole family is a member of the church. My parents met there. </p>
    <p>I have not yet served the mission. I'm still not sure, I am still thinking about it. 
        At the moment I work taking care of two children of a sister of the church. As I like music very much 
        music I plan to save money to be able to go to several concerts! :)</p>
    <p>My experience with Pathway has been very fruitful, I really like the idea of studying with people who live the same values as me! 
        Two years ago I graduated from high school and I wasn't sure what to study.It was hard for me to decide what to study but my father 
        entered to study web development at BYU-Idaho. and he made me know about Front end, I like to design and create so I was able to have 
        the opportunity to experiment with the Pathway program and it was a very good decision. I am very grateful for that. 
        I think that actually the tectological careers give a lot of fruits and I am happy to have the opportunity to learn with very good people.</p>
    <p>Thank you for looking my web page.</p>
